# Startup Success and Failure Analysis ðŸ”¬
![](https://github.com/daniel7an/Startup-Success-Analysis/blob/main/startup.jpg)

## Overview
This project aims to analyze factors contributing to the success or failure of startups through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The dataset contains various attributes related to 472 startup companies.

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
  - Handling incorrect values and converting relevant columns to appropriate data types.
  - Dealing with missing data by dropping columns with excessive missing values and imputing missing values based on distribution.
  - Encoding categorical data using one-hot encoding for binary columns and label encoding for the rest.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Distribution analysis to understand the distribution of variables.
  - Feature importance analysis using techniques like Random Forest to identify significant contributors to startup success or failure.
  - Visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to illustrate relationships between variables.

## Conclusion
By conducting a comprehensive analysis encompassing data preprocessing, EDA, and potentially predictive modeling, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing startup outcomes. This project will offer a detailed overview of the methodology, code implementation, and results.
